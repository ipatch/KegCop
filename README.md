<a id="objective"></a>

## Objective

The purpose of this software is to create user accounts for a kegerator, and have a **_root_** account which recieves donations from the users for the beer they drink.  To find out more information about the project check out the [wiki](https://github.com/ipatch/KegCop/wiki)

<a id="how-does-it-work"></a>

## How does it work

An iOS device, i.e. iPhone / iPod Touch will connect to a Bluno via Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy sending serial information to the microcontroller which will communicate with flow sensor(s) and a solenoid cut off valve.  The iOS device will be the user interface for the entire operation, storing account information along with how many credits a particular user will have.

## Build

As of January 17, 2019, I'm building the **KegCop.app** with Xcode Version 10.1 (10B61) to build the app for iOS 9.3.x on an iPod Touch 5th generation model.

> The iPod Touch 5th Gen has the same screen size and specs as iPhone 5 and 5s, which is useful to know when building using the Simulator.

To build this app from a CLI using **xcodebuild** [see](https://github.com/ipatch/KegCop/wiki#building-from-a-cli)

## Contributing

I would love for someone to make a branch and start editing some code.  My Objective-C skills leave
a lot to be desired.  So if you have a great idea, don't hesitate to download the code and
contribute.  There is a guide for contributing, [here](https://github.com/ipatch/KegCop/wiki/Contribute)

<a id="installation"></a>

## Installation

- Clone this repo, then build for your device using Xcode.
- Load the following sketch on your Bluno, from [here](https://github.com/ipatch/KegCop/blob/master/KegCop-Bluno-sketch.c)

<a id="todos"></a>

## TODOs

- [ ] add instructions for building app, ie. **KegCop.ipa** from CLI.
