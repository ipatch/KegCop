<a id="objective"></a>

## Objective

The purpose of this software is to create user accounts for a kegerator, and have a **_root_** account which recieves donations from the users for the beer they drink.  To find out more information about the project check out the [wiki](https://github.com/ipatch/KegCop/wiki)

<a id="how-does-it-work"></a>

## How does it work

An iOS device, i.e. iPhone / iPod Touch will connect to a Bluno via Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy sending serial information to the microcontroller which will communicate with flow sensor(s) and a solenoid cut off valve.  The iOS device will be the user interface for the entire operation, storing account information along with how many credits a particular user will have.

## Build

As of January 17, 2019, I'm building the **KegCop.app** with Xcode Version 10.1 (10B61) to build the app for iOS 9.3.x on an iPod Touch 5th generation model.

> The iPod Touch 5th Gen has the same screen size and specs as iPhone 5 and 5s, which is useful to know when building using the Simulator.

As of Feburary 15, 2018 iOS >= 8.0 is required in order to run KegCop and the preffered build system is Xcode 9.2.

## Contributing

I would love for someone to make a branch and start editing some code.  My Objective-C skills leave
a lot to be desired.  So if you have a great idea, don't hesitate to download the code and
contribute.  There is a guide for contributing, [here](https://github.com/ipatch/KegCop/wiki/Contribute)

### Contributing > Maintenance

<details>
<summary>Revert from nuclear ü§Ø **git** changes</summary>

#### Workaround > git

god forbid‚Äö‚Ñ¢Ô∏è I **merge** then **push** a branch into master that I did not mean to, perform the below steps

```shell
git reset --hard [tag/branch/commit id]
echo "reset local working branch, ie. [master] to one of the specified fields"
git push [remote(s)] -f
echo "[remote] can be `origin` or `upstream`"
echo "NOTE: the above two step should revert a brach local and remote from nuclear changes"
```

```

There is a git branch **gh-pages-src** that contains a node project to build a website using github pages for the aboe listed URL, that branch src does not correlate to the main objc src for the actual iOS app, but only serves a purpose to be the directory / src for the accompanying website.

## Installation

- Clone this repo, then build for your device using Xcode.
- Load the following sketch on your Bluno, from [here](https://github.com/ipatch/KegCop/blob/master/KegCop-Bluno-sketch.c)
