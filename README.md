## Objective
The purpose of this software is to create user accounts for a kegerator, and have a root account which recieves donations from the users for the beer they drink.  To find out more information about the project check out the [wiki](https://github.com/ipatch/KegCop/wiki)

## How does it work?
An iOS device, i.e. iPhone / iPod Touch will connect to a Bluno via Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy sending serial information to the microcontroller which will communicate with flow sensor(s) and a solenoid cut off valve.  The iOS device will be the user interface for the entire operation, storing account information along with how many credits a particular user will have.

## Build
As of 8MAR15, this project is built with Xcode 6.1 using OS X (10.10.2) with a target for iOS 7.x and greater.

## Contributing
I would love for someone to make a branch and start editing some code.  My Objective-C skills leave
a lot to be desired.  So if you have a great idea, don't hesitate to download the code and
contribute.  There is a guide for contributing, [here](https://github.com/ipatch/KegCop/wiki/Contribute)

## Installation
STAY TUNED, and load the following sketch on your Bluno, from [here](https://github.com/ipatch/KegCop/blob/master/KegCop-Bluno-sketch.c)<br />
