# KegCop [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ipatch/KegCop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ipatch/KegCop)

[![Wilson demos KegCop](http://img.youtube.com/vi/1a6hxUb3zfU/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a6hxUb3zfU) 

## Objective
The purpose of this software is to create user accounts for a kegerator, and have a **_root_** account which recieves donations from the users for the beer they drink.  To find out more information about the project check out the [wiki](https://github.com/ipatch/KegCop/wiki)

## How does it work?
An iOS device, i.e. iPhone / iPod Touch will connect to a Bluno via Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy sending serial information to the microcontroller which will communicate with flow sensor(s) and a solenoid cut off valve.  The iOS device will be the user interface for the entire operation, storing account information along with how many credits a particular user will have.

~~As of 24SEP15, this project is built with Xcode 7 using OS X (10.10.5) with a target for iOS 7.x and greater.~~

## Contributing
I would love for someone to make a branch and start editing some code.  My Objective-C skills leave
a lot to be desired.  So if you have a great idea, don't hesitate to download the code and
contribute.  There is a guide for contributing, [here](https://github.com/ipatch/KegCop/wiki/Contribute)

## Installation
- Clone this repo, then build for your device using Xcode.
- Load the following sketch on your Bluno, from [here](https://github.com/ipatch/KegCop/blob/master/KegCop-Bluno-sketch.c)
