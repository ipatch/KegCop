<a id="objective"></a>

## Objective

The purpose of this software is to create user accounts for a kegerator, and have a **_root_** account which recieves donations from the users for the beer they drink.  To find out more information about the project check out the [wiki](https://github.com/ipatch/KegCop/wiki)

<a id="how-does-it-work"></a>

## How does it work

An iOS device, i.e. iPhone / iPod Touch will connect to a Bluno via Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy sending serial information to the microcontroller which will communicate with flow sensor(s) and a solenoid cut off valve.  The iOS device will be the user interface for the entire operation, storing account information along with how many credits a particular user will have.

## Contributing

I would love for someone to make a branch and start editing some code.  My Objective-C skills leave
a lot to be desired.  So if you have a great idea, don't hesitate to download the code and
contribute.  There is a guide for contributing, [here](https://github.com/ipatch/KegCop/wiki/Contribute)
