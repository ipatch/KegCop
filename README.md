# KegCop - README

## Objective
The purpose of this software is to create user accounts for a kegerator, and have a root account which recieves donations from the users for the beer they drink.

## How will it work?
An iDevice, i.e. iPhone will connect to an Arduino via serial communication / iPhone connector cable sending serial information to the Arduino which will communicate with flow sensor(s) and a solenoid cut off valve.  The iDevice will be the user interface for the entire operation, storing account information along with how many credits a particular user will have.

## Build
As of 26SEP12, this project will be built with Xcode 4.5 using OS X (10.8.2)

This project was built with Xcode 4.3.2 and the target iOS is 5.1.1

## Contributing
I would love for someone to make a branch and start editing some code.  My Objective-C skills leave
a lot to be desired.  So if you have a great idea, don't hesitate to download the code and
contribute.

## Installation
A binary version of the app can be downloaded if your iDevice is jailbroken.  Add the following
